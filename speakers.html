            <div class="speaker-card" onclick="openModal('Mr Yip Hon Weng', 'The Power of Resilience: Turning Challenges into Opportunities', 'assets/speakers/1.png', `Yip Hon Weng is a first-term Member of Parliament for Yio Chu Kang SMC, with a distinguished career in the Singapore Administrative Service. He has held senior roles in key ministries, including the Prime Minister’s Office, Health, Defence, and National Development, where he led transformative initiatives like the Municipal Services Office to enhance community services. As the founding director of the Ageing Planning Office and head of the Silver Generation Office, Hon Weng championed seniors’ issues, overseeing nationwide outreach programs that impacted over 500,000 Singaporeans. Now a Director at Temasek, he leads human capital strategies and previously drove investments in deep technology to bolster Singapore’s economic growth. Renowned for bridging high-level policy with on-the-ground implementation, Hon Weng is committed to serving the community. A graduate of prestigious institutions including MIT, Harvard, NUS, NTU, and UK universities, he holds degrees in advanced mathematics, financial engineering, and public administration, reflecting his diverse expertise and leadership. He is married with 5 children.`, `In reflecting on his journey, Yip Hon Weng recognizes that the true power of resilience lies not in merely enduring hardship, but in transforming it into a stepping stone for growth. His experiences as a young person—grappling with academic pressures, societal expectations, and moments of self-doubt—taught him that resilience is not just a passive trait. It is the capacity to adapt, learn, and emerge stronger from life’s challenges. This ability to turn obstacles into opportunities became the very foundation of his success. Yip believes that failure is not the end, but rather a crucial teacher along the way. He recalls key moments where setbacks forced him to innovate, rethink, and discover parts of himself he hadn’t known before. These failures ultimately propelled him forward, guiding him to where he is today as a Member of Parliament. Through his journey, he has also come to understand that resilience cannot be built in isolation. It’s the unwavering support of family, mentors, and peers that nurtures the emotional and psychological strength needed to face an ever-changing world. In sharing his story, Yip hopes to encourage young people to reframe their understanding of challenges. By embracing resilience not just as a skill but as a mindset, they can unlock their potential and navigate uncertainty with confidence. For Yip, resilience is not only something that shapes an individual but also something that shapes communities—empowering people to rise above, contribute meaningfully, and create a future of collective progress.`)">

            Alya Annabi shares how a simple act of slowing down helped her recognise the misalignment between her job and her true aspirations.

She invites the audience to step away from digital distractions, embrace uncertainty, and find clarity in the most unexpected moments.

He founded the World Toilet Organization (WTO), a global non-profit working towards a world with clean, safe toilets and sanitation for everyone, everywhere, at all times. Born in a slum in Singapore in 1957, he learned entrepreneurship and gumption from his uneducated mother who started a series of small businesses. He was also inspired by the gumption of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and grew up watching the amazing transformation of his country from third world to first.
            From school failure, he became a serial commercial businessman (sixteen businesses). After attaining financial independence he left the rat-race to become a serial social entrepreneur. After fighting the bureaucrats, he enrolled at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and graduated with a Master’s in Public Administration at the age of 56. He also graduated at Singularity University’s Global Solutions Program at age fifty-nine. Some of the awards he won are: Schwab Fellow of the World Economic Forum, Ashoka Global Fellow, Queen Elizabeth’s Points of Light Award, Clinton Global Initiatives Fellow, Time Magazine’s Heroes of the Environment for 2008. For his contribution to humanity, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow UK in 2022.`, `For centuries, knowledge was power. The arbitrage between those who know and those who don't would determine their destiny.\n
            Education is an opportunity for people to move up the prosperity ladder. But our current rote learning mode is becoming relatively obsolete in the era of AI, AGI and eventually, BCI (brain-computer integration).\n
            When I was given a 10 weeks scholarship at the Singularity University at NASA in 2016, I was shocked that all the emerging 200 new technologies were anti-jobs.\n
            Since humans can't become better robots, our only chance of survival is to be better humans to prevail over the robots.\n
            Come and listen to how Gumption is now the most essential survival skill that our school did not teach you.`)">

Concurrently, he is a Nonresident Fellow at The National Bureau of Asia Research (NBR), the United States, and a member of RIPS Research Committee, the Research Institute for Peace and Security (RIPS), Japan. His research focuses on International Security, International/Regional Institutions (particularly ASEAN), and East Asian/Indo-Pacific security.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), NTU in 2010. He received his Ph.D. in International Relations at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.`, `In today's multipolar world, leadership faces the temptation of populism, offering simple solutions that often neglect long-term consequences. Power politics matters to maintain stability, but divisions within and between nation-states threaten global stability, underscoring the need for unity. Engaging in blame games hampers progress; instead, leaders should focus on constructive engagement and dialogue. By clearly articulating choices and aligning words with actions, leaders can foster trust and guide societies toward sustainable futures.`)">

            <div class="speaker-card" onclick="openModal('Mr Wesley Ng', 'Why you should live like a 7 year old', 'assets/speakers/5.png', `Wesley Ng is an incoming undergraduate and current national serviceman who works extensively with children in multiple roles. As a Global Community Builder and student volunteer at Junior Achievement Singapore, he teaches financial literacy to children, while also leading Cake From The Hearts—a non-profit organization he founded to celebrate the
            birthdays of underprivileged children.
            
            Through these experiences, Wesley has observed firsthand the natural curiosity, creativity,
            and fearlessness that children possess—qualities that adults often lose as they age. His
            mission is to help others recognize and reclaim these valuable childhood traits, applying them to overcome modern adult challenges and rediscover the things that made life extraordinary.`, `As we age, we lose our innate ability to question why and challenge assumptions, replacing
wonder with indifference and fearless curiosity with social anxiety. Using age seven as a
touchpoint - a time when we were old enough to explore yet young enough to marvel at
everything - this speech explores the transformative power of childlike curiosity.
We'll examine how two major factors erode our curiosity: the numbing routine of daily life
and the fear of judgment in social interactions. I share my month-long experiment of living
like my seven-year-old self, which transformed not just individual interactions but my entire
worldview - from striking up conversations with strangers to rediscovering my fascination
with constellations.
The speech weaves together compelling neuroscience research - showing how curiosity
triggers dopamine release, enhances memory formation, and even correlates with longevity -
with practical, time-bound strategies anyone can implement. These include the 'First Time'
technique for daily activities, a 'Seven-Year-Old Timer' for social situations, and the 'Why'
journal for cultivating daily curiosity.
Drawing the crucial distinction between being childish and being childlike, I showcase how
great innovators like Einstein and Marie Curie succeeded because of their childlike wonder.
In our AI-driven era, where machines can answer any question, human curiosity becomes
more valuable than ever. While AI can provide answers, it takes human curiosity to question
assumptions and imagine new possibilities - making our childlike wonder not just personally
fulfilling, but essential for addressing humanity's complex challenges.

They have no fancy
            accolades, no groundbreaking research to their name, but they do have an unfortunate habit of going down ideological rabbit holes instead of doing actual work.
            
            Between cramming for exams and questioning their life choices, they’ve noticed something odd:
            everyone seems to think they’re the hero of history. Every ideology claims to champion freedom,
            justice, or equality precisely until you disagree with them. This talk isn’t about giving you the “right” answers (if they had those, they’d be much richer), but it might make you question just how much of what you believe is actually yours, and how much is just borrowed from the
            loudest voices around you.
            And if nothing else, at least it’ll be more interesting than another GP lecture.`, `The speaker highlights a paradox: those who preach inclusivity often silence dissent. In today’s hyper-connected world, conformity isn’t enforced by law: it’s self-imposed, driven by fear of
exile. Social media turns expression into performance, where deviation invites punishment, not
debate. This performative conformity is more insidious than traditional oppression. It doesn’t just demand obedience, it trains people to anticipate the 'right' opinions, shaping beliefs out of fear rather than conviction. The result? An illusion of progress masking intellectual stagnation. History’s greatest minds weren’t celebrated for blending in. They shattered consensus. Yet
today, we rebuild the cages they fought to break, mistaking ideological purity for true diversity. The speaker seeks to contend that a world without disagreement is a world without growth.`)">
