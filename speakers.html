He founded the World Toilet Organization (WTO), a global non-profit working towards a world with clean, safe toilets and sanitation for everyone, everywhere, at all times. Born in a slum in Singapore in 1957, he learned entrepreneurship and gumption from his uneducated mother who started a series of small businesses. He was also inspired by the gumption of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and grew up watching the amazing transformation of his country from third world to first.
            From school failure, he became a serial commercial businessman (sixteen businesses). After attaining financial independence he left the rat-race to become a serial social entrepreneur. After fighting the bureaucrats, he enrolled at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and graduated with a Master’s in Public Administration at the age of 56. He also graduated at Singularity University’s Global Solutions Program at age fifty-nine. Some of the awards he won are: Schwab Fellow of the World Economic Forum, Ashoka Global Fellow, Queen Elizabeth’s Points of Light Award, Clinton Global Initiatives Fellow, Time Magazine’s Heroes of the Environment for 2008. For his contribution to humanity, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow UK in 2022.`, `For centuries, knowledge was power. The arbitrage between those who know and those who don't would determine their destiny.\n
            Education is an opportunity for people to move up the prosperity ladder. But our current rote learning mode is becoming relatively obsolete in the era of AI, AGI and eventually, BCI (brain-computer integration).\n
            When I was given a 10 weeks scholarship at the Singularity University at NASA in 2016, I was shocked that all the emerging 200 new technologies were anti-jobs.\n
            Since humans can't become better robots, our only chance of survival is to be better humans to prevail over the robots.\n
            Come and listen to how Gumption is now the most essential survival skill that our school did not teach you.`)">

            <div class="speaker-card" onclick="openModal('Mr Wesley Ng', 'Why you should live like a 7 year old', 'assets/speakers/5.png', `Wesley Ng is an incoming undergraduate and current national serviceman who works extensively with children in multiple roles. As a Global Community Builder and student volunteer at Junior Achievement Singapore, he teaches financial literacy to children, while also leading Cake From The Hearts—a non-profit organization he founded to celebrate the
            birthdays of underprivileged children.
            
            Through these experiences, Wesley has observed firsthand the natural curiosity, creativity,
            and fearlessness that children possess—qualities that adults often lose as they age. His
            mission is to help others recognize and reclaim these valuable childhood traits, applying them to overcome modern adult challenges and rediscover the things that made life extraordinary.`, `As we age, we lose our innate ability to question why and challenge assumptions, replacing
wonder with indifference and fearless curiosity with social anxiety. Using age seven as a
touchpoint - a time when we were old enough to explore yet young enough to marvel at
everything - this speech explores the transformative power of childlike curiosity.
We'll examine how two major factors erode our curiosity: the numbing routine of daily life
and the fear of judgment in social interactions. I share my month-long experiment of living
like my seven-year-old self, which transformed not just individual interactions but my entire
worldview - from striking up conversations with strangers to rediscovering my fascination
with constellations.
The speech weaves together compelling neuroscience research - showing how curiosity
triggers dopamine release, enhances memory formation, and even correlates with longevity -
with practical, time-bound strategies anyone can implement. These include the 'First Time'
technique for daily activities, a 'Seven-Year-Old Timer' for social situations, and the 'Why'
journal for cultivating daily curiosity.
Drawing the crucial distinction between being childish and being childlike, I showcase how
great innovators like Einstein and Marie Curie succeeded because of their childlike wonder.
In our AI-driven era, where machines can answer any question, human curiosity becomes
more valuable than ever. While AI can provide answers, it takes human curiosity to question
assumptions and imagine new possibilities - making our childlike wonder not just personally
fulfilling, but essential for addressing humanity's complex challenges.

As someone whose entire personality is mostly about her dogs, she will do her best to talk about something else for once. She looks forward to seeing you there at TEDx!', `Relying on labels or biases to make decisions is often easy, but not always accurate or helpful. Labels help simplify complex ideas, making it easier to categorize and understand the world quickly. However, they are often too simplistic for us to use them to conceptualise the nuance and depth of important ideas. Once a label is internalised it can shape future behaviour and decisions in a biased way without us realizing it. While some of these biases may be able to help us to clarify or to establish a sense of identity, they can make it more difficult to engage with the world and with ideas in an open-minded way.`)">

A figure skater on the Singapore National Team, she represents Singapore in international competitions. She is a local

            of accolades, however, is the most important thing about Ilika: she is not afraid to fail.`, `Despite seeming antithetical to figure skating, the first skill taught in beginner skating classes is
how to fall. Why, then, is failure not a skill taught to us from young? Instead, most children grow up fearing failure, a trait that is detrimental to their future success. In her talk, through her
personal experiences with falling and failure in figure skating, Ilika Motani will discuss the why
and how of learning to fail.

Almost everyone has entertained this thought at some point, and among all other forms of writing, poetry has a good claim to be the least understood.

They have no fancy
            accolades, no groundbreaking research to their name, but they do have an unfortunate habit of going down ideological rabbit holes instead of doing actual work.
            
            Between cramming for exams and questioning their life choices, they’ve noticed something odd:
            everyone seems to think they’re the hero of history. Every ideology claims to champion freedom,
            justice, or equality precisely until you disagree with them. This talk isn’t about giving you the “right” answers (if they had those, they’d be much richer), but it might make you question just how much of what you believe is actually yours, and how much is just borrowed from the
            loudest voices around you.
            And if nothing else, at least it’ll be more interesting than another GP lecture.`, `The speaker highlights a paradox: those who preach inclusivity often silence dissent. In today’s hyper-connected world, conformity isn’t enforced by law: it’s self-imposed, driven by fear of
exile. Social media turns expression into performance, where deviation invites punishment, not
debate. This performative conformity is more insidious than traditional oppression. It doesn’t just demand obedience, it trains people to anticipate the 'right' opinions, shaping beliefs out of fear rather than conviction. The result? An illusion of progress masking intellectual stagnation. History’s greatest minds weren’t celebrated for blending in. They shattered consensus. Yet
today, we rebuild the cages they fought to break, mistaking ideological purity for true diversity. The speaker seeks to contend that a world without disagreement is a world without growth.`)">
